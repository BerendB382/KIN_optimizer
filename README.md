# KIN_optimizer
Experimentation with the Keplerian Integration Netwerk (KIN) developed by Andreas Merrath. 

Much of the code was written by Andreas Merrath, supervised by Felix Dietrich. I owe him many thanks. As of writing, I'm about a third of the way through my Master's project, where I am to apply the KIN to astrophysical use-cases, such as the Trappist exoplanetary system or the S-stars in orbit around the central supermassive black hole of the Milky Way.
