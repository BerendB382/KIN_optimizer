# KIN_optimizer
Experimentation with the Keplerian Integration Netwerk (KIN) developed by Andreas Merrath. 

Much of the code was written by Andreas Merrath, supervised by Felix Dietrich. I owe him many thanks. 
The Validation and test_KIN folders contain modules where the KIN can be tested on any N body system.
