To enable the following instructions: AVX2 AVX512F FMA, in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.
let us generate a system
Downloading exoplanet data from explanets.org exoplanet archive
Saved data to file:  pyasl/resBased/eporg.csv.gz  in data directory,
  which has been configured as:  /home/s2818760/PyAData
By default, the data will be downloaded anew every 7 days.
You can use the `changeDownloadCycle` to change this behavior.
